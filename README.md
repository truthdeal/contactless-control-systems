# "Kontaktlose Steuerungssysteme mit dem Chip unter der Haut" Project

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the materials related to the bachelor's thesis "Kontaktlose Steuerungssysteme mit dem Chip unter der Haut". This project aims to create a contactless control system through a chip inserted under the skin. It targets two main applications: one chip for door mechanisms and the other for daily passes. The project is divided into five main sections, namely mechanical design and manufacturing, electronic design and assembly, chip reading and writing, software creation and installation, and testing and validation.

The system aims to contribute to the health tourism market, considering the usage of subcutaneous chips can potentially improve convenience in various domains. The chips do not require complex production methods, which allows for domestic production and can contribute to the economy by creating new markets and increasing employment.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into several folders, each dedicated to different components of the project:

- **3D Design**: This folder contains CAD files and 3D printer instructions for the mechanical components of the system. Here you'll find the designs for the casing and any physical components necessary for the system's operations.

- **Code**: Here is where the programming part of the project resides. This includes Arduino code for controlling the RFID reader circuit, as well as software for interacting with the NFC and RFID chips.

- **Media**: This folder is dedicated to any media related to the project, such as images, videos, or diagrams that help to better understand or illustrate the system.

- **Montage**: This section contains files related to the assembly of the electronic components of the system, including the Arduino microcontroller and the Proxmark3 RFID and NFC reader and programmer.

- **Testen**: This folder is dedicated to testing and validation of the project. It includes mechanical tests.

Two additional files in the repository are:

- **160501108_Baris_Arya_CANTEPE_BachelorArbeit.pptx**: This is a PowerPoint presentation that provides an overview and discusses the highlights of the project. It's a good resource for understanding the broader context and key takeaways of the project.

- **Baris Arya Cantepe - Bachelor Arbeit.pdf**: This is the complete bachelor's thesis paper, providing a detailed description of the project, the methodology used, the results achieved, and a discussion of these results.

Please feel free to explore the repository for a more in-depth understanding of the project. Any contributions or feedback are appreciated.
